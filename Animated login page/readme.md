## 📂 Project Structure

```
📁 Login-SignUp-Page/
├── index.html        # Main structure
├── style.css         # Styles for layout and animation
├── script.js         # JavaScript logic
├── 1.jpg             # Background image for body
├── 2.jpg             # Background image for form container
└── README.md         # Documentation

```

## 🧠 How It Works

- The layout consists of two forms: **Sign In** and **Sign Up**, placed side by side.
- An **overlay panel** slides to show the corresponding form using a CSS class toggle.
- JavaScript handles:
  - Switching between panels via buttons
  - Toggling password visibility (👁️ to 🙈)
  - Showing error messages if fields are empty (optional expansion)
