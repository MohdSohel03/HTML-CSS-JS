## ⚙️ How It Works

- Uses `Date()` object in JavaScript to update:
  - Time (`hh:mm:ss AM/PM`)
  - Date (`DD/MM/YYYY`)
  - Day (`Monday`, `Tuesday`, etc.)
- Neon glow effect via CSS `@keyframes`
- Light/Dark theme managed using CSS custom properties (`:root` and `.dark-mode`)
- Theme toggle with emoji switch (`🌙` <=> `☀️`)

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout adapts for mobile view:

- Clock font shrinks
- Date and Day stack vertically
- Padding adjusts for smaller screens
